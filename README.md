# jean_armstrong_vog_backend_codechallenge

An app following the instructions provided in the Vog CodeChallengeV4

##How to run
This is a simple app, there are no external dependencies necessary to include in order to run.

##q1: 

I would ask the team if there was a typo in the solution name -- assumed I got a response of yes.  So I named my app _vog_backend_codechallenge  NOT vog_backend_codechalleneg
